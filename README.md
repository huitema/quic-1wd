# QUIC Time Stamp

Proposition for a time stamp frame in QUIC packets. This can be used to track variations of 1 way delays in QUIC.

The current draft is [quic-ts.mkd](https://github.com/huitema/quic-ts/blob/master/quic-ts.mkd).
This is the evolution of an initial draft focused on one way delay measurements [quic-1wd](https://github.com/huitema/quic-ts/blob/master/quic-1wd.mkd).
The new draft was renamed to focus on the actual deliverable, a timestamp frame.
